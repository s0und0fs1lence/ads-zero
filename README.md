# üöÄ ads-zero

**ads-zero** is an alpha-stage alerting system built for modern marketers. It fetches campaign data from channels like **Facebook**, **Google**, **TikTok**, and **Taboola**, applies customizable rules, and sends notifications via **email**, **Telegram**, or **Slack** when conditions are met.

> **Note:** Currently, only the Facebook integration is implemented, with ClickHouse used for data storage. Postgres support is planned along with additional data sources. The Kafka engine for scalable deployment is fully implemented.

## üìä Project Status

- **Alpha Stage:** Minimal implementation for Facebook data integration.
- **Storage:** ClickHouse is the current working solution. Postgres support is planned.
- **Deployment:** Supports both single component mode (internal ticker) and scalable deployment using Kafka.
- **Configuration:** Alerts are currently configured through database table records. A JSON-based configuration interface is planned for users who do not need long-term data storage.
